## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I've learned about debugging my code to resolve any unexpected behaviors. I've also learned  about using gradients and how to use Sass to write more efficient and flexible CSS code.


### Continued development

I want to understand more about how Flexbox works, I'm still having some trouble getting my layouts exactly how I want it to be. Using Sass was an interesting experience, and I'm looking forward to using it more. I've learned that spending more time planning beforehand can be helpful. When I had a clear plan, I was able to complete the work quickly, but I struggled to get started because I was overthinking the CSS before actually working on the page.
